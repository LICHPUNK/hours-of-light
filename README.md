*Based on Bruno Imbrizi's "Hours of Dark" piece. Each stroke seen is representative of a day in the year. The width of each stroke is proportional to the amount of light in each day, and their orientation represents the angle of the sunrise on that given day based on the position of the observer (in this case I've used 30Â°). This orientation was calculated using the solar zenith angle and the sunrise equation to derive when the sunrise would occur and use that information to interpret the angle of the sunrise for each day. Hoping to take more variables into account, such as an adjustable longitude, down the line.*
